# numbertests
Test framework and data for the number package.

This program parses decimal arithmetic tests data provided by Mike Cowlishaw via the [General Decimal Arithmetic website](https://speleotrove.com/decimal/). 

It uses the arithmetic assertions in those tests to validate the [number package](github.com/djfritz/number).
